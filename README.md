# A Simple Emulator for MOS Technologies 6502 Processor

I am starting this project for my personal learning on how CPUs' work. I don't know where it will go, but I hope to learn a lot from it.

## Resources That I Use

-   [Dave Poo's "6502 CPU Emulator in C++" Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLwK93hM93Z13TRzPx9JqTIn33feefl37)
-   [Andrew Jacobs' website archived on 6502.org](http://www.6502.org/users/obelisk/6502/)
-   [Aidan Lakshman's 6502 emulator and blog posts about it](https://www.ahl27.com/posts/2023/01/6502-emu1/)
-   [Neil Parker's information about 6502 opcodes](https://llx.com/Neil/a2/opcodes.html)
-   [MOS Programming Manuel](https://archive.org/details/mos_microcomputers_programming_manual)

## Testing

I'm using [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) for writing my tests and I will be using for the first time.  
The tests can be found in the `test` directory. `test/src` only contains the **Unity** source code while other folders include the tests that I wrote.
