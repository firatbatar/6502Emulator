# A Simple Emulator for MOS Technologies 6502 Processor

I am starting this project for my personal learning on how CPUs' work. I don't know where it will go, but I hope to learn a lot from it.

## Resources That I Use

-   [Andrew Jacobs' website archived on 6502.org](http://www.6502.org/users/obelisk/6502/)
-   [Aidan Lakshman's 6502 emulator and blog posts about it](https://www.ahl27.com/posts/2023/01/6502-emu1/)
