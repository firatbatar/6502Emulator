# A Simple Emulator for MOS Technologies 6502 Processor

I am starting this project for my personal learning on how CPUs' work. I don't know how much I'll go with it.

I'm mostly fallowing the great series by Dave Poo [6502 CPU Emulator in C++](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLwK93hM93Z13TRzPx9JqTIn33feefl37), but I will work on C not C++.
